# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage was built as part of the homework assignment for the UNB Boot Camp course.  It is designed to help me keep track of and show the world what I am learning in this course.  
I think this is helpful to showcase some of the things I learned in the program as it progresses.  I can direct people to this site to show my progress and let me know what I am learning.  
So far, I have learned basic HTML, CSS and Javascript.  As well as how to use Git and GitHub to store and track changes to this project.  I have also learned how to use VS Code and I have learned how to have a developer mindset.  

## Installation

## Usage

This webpage has four sections:  HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. The webpage is setup to record information about what I have learned in the Prework program.  When you view the 
Developer Tools in Chrome, you can see the work I have done with Javascript.
